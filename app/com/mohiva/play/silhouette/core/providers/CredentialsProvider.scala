 * A provider for authenticating with credentials.

 * the hashing algorithm used by the application. But the hashes stored in the backing store can't be converted back
 * into plain text passwords, to hash them again with the new algorithm. So if a user successfully authenticates after
 * the application has changed the hashing algorithm, the provider hashes the entered password again with the new
 * algorithm and stores the auth info in the backing store.
