Welcome to Silhouette's documentation!
======================================

**Silhouette** is an authentication library for Play Framework
applications that supports several authentication methods, including
OAuth1, OAuth2, OpenID, Credentials or custom authentication schemes.

It can be integrated as is, or used as a building block and customized
to meet specific application requirements, thanks to its loosely coupled
design.

The project is named after the fictional crime fighter character
`Silhouette`_, from the Watchmen `graphic novel`_ and `movie`_.
