Providers
=========

In Silhouette a provider is a service that handles the authentication of
an identity. It typically reads authorization information and returns
information about an identity.

Request providers
-----------------

Request providers are special types of providers. They can be hocked directly into
incoming requests which gets scanned for credentials and either gain or restrict
access to the protected resources. This can be useful for machine authentication.

When using a request provider, you should consider to use the :ref:`dummy authenticator
<dummy_authenticator>`, because it doesn't have any network throughput or memory footprint
compared to other authenticators.

Credentials provider
--------------------

Silhouette supports local authentication, typically via an HTML form,
with the credentials provider. This provider accepts credentials and returns
the login information for an identity after a successful authentication.
Typically credentials consist of an identifier (a username or email address)
and a password.

The credentials provider supports changing the password hashing algorithm on the
fly. Sometimes it may be possible to change the hashing algorithm used by the
application. But the hashes stored in the backing store can’t be converted back
into plain text passwords to hash them again with the new algorithm. So if a user
successfully authenticates after the application has changed the hashing algorithm,
the provider hashes the entered password again with the new algorithm and stores the
authentication info in the backing store.


Basic Authentication provider
-----------------------------

Silhouette supports `basic access authentication`_ as described in `RFC 2617`_.
This provider is an implementation of a request provider which accepts the current
request and returns the login information for an identity after a successful authentication.

The basic authentication provider supports changing the password hashing algorithm
on the fly. Sometimes it may be possible to change the hashing algorithm used by the
application. But the hashes stored in the backing store can’t be converted back into
plain text passwords to hash them again with the new algorithm. So if a user successfully
authenticates after the application has changed the hashing algorithm, the provider
hashes the entered password again with the new algorithm and stores the authentication
info in the backing store.

Social providers
----------------

A social provider allows a user to authenticate an identity on your website
with an existing account from an external social website like Facebook,
Google or Twitter. Following you can find a list of all supported
providers grouped by authentication protocol.

^^^^^^

-  LinkedInProvider (www.linkedin.com)
-  TwitterProvider (www.twitter.com)
-  XingProvider (www.xing.com)

OAuth2
^^^^^^

-  GoogleProvider (www.google.com)
-  InstagramProvider (www.instagram.com)
-  LinkedInProvider (www.linkedin.com)
-  VKProvider (www.vk.com)


Social profile
--------------

The social profile contains the profile data returned from the social providers.
Silhouette provides a default social profile called `CommonSocialProfile`_,
which contains the most common profile data providers return.

.. _CommonSocialProfile: https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette/blob/master/app/com/mohiva/play/silhouette/impl/providers/SocialProvider.scala#L168

Social profile builders and parsers
-----------------------------------

Some providers return a superset of the information in `CommonSocialProfile`_,
for example the location or gender of the user. Silouette's “profile builders”
allow you to construct custom profiles without duplicating existing code. Instead
of overriding the provider to return the additional profile information, developers
can mix in a profile builder which adds only the programming logic for the additional
fields.

Every profile builder must define a profile parser, which transforms the content returned
from the provider, into a social profile instance. Parsers can then be reused by other
parsers to avoid code duplication.

Default social profile builders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All provider implementations are abstract because a profile builder must be
specified before an object can be instantiated. Every provider ships with a
default profile builder, an implementation of ``CommonSocialProfileBuilder``,
which returns a ``CommonSocialProfile`` after successful authentication. However,
it can't be mixed into the provider by default because Scala doesn't allow us to
override a concrete type with a different concrete type. That is, mixing in a
default builder would prevent customization.

Silhouette handles this problem by leaving the provider class abstract but making the
companion object's ``apply`` method handle the most common case --
instantiating a provider with an implementation of ``CommonSocialProfileBuilder``.
So in most cases you should simply call the apply method and instead of using the
``new`` keyword:

.. code-block:: scala

    FacebookProvider(httpLayer, stateProvider, settings)

Write a custom social profile builder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As noted above it is very easy to write your own profile builder
implementations. Let's take a look on the following code examples. The
first one defines a custom social profile that differs from the common
social profile by the additional gender field.

.. code-block:: scala

  case class CustomSocialProfile(
    loginInfo: LoginInfo,
    firstName: Option[String] = None,
    lastName: Option[String] = None,
    fullName: Option[String] = None,
    email: Option[String] = None,
    avatarURL: Option[String] = None,
    gender: Option[String] = None) extends SocialProfile

As next we create the parser which uses the default Facebook profile
parser to avoid code duplication.

.. code-block:: scala

  class CustomFacebookProfileParser extends SocialProfileParser[JsValue, CustomSocialProfile] {

    /**
     * The common social profile parser.
     */
    val commonParser = new FacebookProfileParser

    /**
     * Parses the social profile.
     *
     * @param json The content returned from the provider.
     * @return The social profile from given result.
     */
    def parse(json: JsValue) = commonParser.parse(json).map { commonProfile =>
      val gender = (json \ "gender").as[String]
      CustomSocialProfile(
        loginInfo = commonProfile.loginInfo,
        firstName = commonProfile.firstName,
        lastName = commonProfile.lastName,
        fullName = commonProfile.fullName,
        avatarURL = commonProfile.avatarURL,
        email = commonProfile.email,
        gender = Some(gender))
    }
  }

As you can see there is no need to duplicate any Json parsing. The only
thing to do is to query the gender field from the Json response returned
by the Facebook API.

As last we create a profile builder which can then be mixed into the Facebook
provider to return our previously defined custom profile.

.. code-block:: scala

  trait CustomFacebookProfileBuilder {
    self: FacebookProvider =>

    /**
     * The type of the profile a profile builder is responsible for.
     */
    type Profile = CustomSocialProfile

    /**
     * The profile parser.
     */
    val profileParser = new CustomFacebookProfileParser
  }

Now you can mixin the profile builder by instantiating the Facebook
provider with the profile builder.

.. code-block:: scala

  new FacebookProvider(httpLayer, stateProvider, settings) with CustomFacebookProfileBuilder


OAuth2 state
------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0

The OAuth2 protocol supports the `state parameter`_, a value the client can include in the request
and that the server returns as a parameter unmodified in the response. This parameter `should be used mainly`_
to protect an application against `CSRF attacks`_. But it can also be used to remember some
state about the user.

To maintain the state in Silhouette, a state provider must be passed to every OAuth2 authentication
provider. All state provider implementations can be found in the `impl package`_.

.. _state parameter: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1
.. _CSRF attacks: http://www.oauthsecurity.com/#authorization-code-flow
.. _should be used mainly: http://www.thread-safe.com/2014/05/the-correct-use-of-state-parameter-in.html
.. _impl package: https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette/tree/master/app/com/mohiva/play/silhouette/impl/providers/oauth2/state

List of OAuth2 states
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide some built in state providers. But as noted above a customized
state can be implemented to remember some state about a user.

CookieState
'''''''''''

The cookie state works by embedding the state in a cookie. This is one of the preferred methods
from the `OAuth2 RFC`_ and it provides a stateless/scalable approach.

.. Tip::
   Please take a look on the :ref:`configuration settings <oaut2_cookie_state_settings>`, on how
   to configure the provider for this state.

.. _OAuth2 RFC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12


DummyState
''''''''''

The dummy state can be used to avoid state validation. This can be useful if the state
should be validated on client side.


Request extractors
------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0

The default workflow for traditional web applications is it to send values in URL query
parameters but for mobile applications there could be another workflow. So with request
extractors it's possible to extract values send to the client from different parts of
the request. By default Silhouette can read values from query parameters and from request
body containing form-urlencoded, Json or XML data.

As example, if a parameter with the name `code` is needed by Silhouette inside a provider,
then the parameter could be send in the following parts of the request:

**URL Query Parameter**

.. code::

    ?code=value

**Form URL encoded body**

.. code::

    code=value

**Json body**

.. code-block:: json

    {"code": "value"}

**XML body**

.. code-block:: xml

    <code>value</code>

.. Note::
   Parameters send as query parameters have always precedence over parameters send in the
   body of a request. So if a parameter is send in query and in body, then the query parameter
   wins.


Define custom request extractors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to define custom request extractors by providing an implicit `RequestExtractor`_
implementation.

.. _RequestExtractor: https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette/blob/master/app/com/mohiva/play/silhouette/api/util/RequestExtractor.scala#L12


Authentication information
--------------------------

The `AuthInfo`_ implementation contains authentication information such
as access tokens, hashed passwords, and so on -- which
should never be exposed to the public. Each provider defines its own
`AuthInfo`_ implementation.

As with other Silhouette structures that vary in their implementation,
`AuthInfo`_ is managed by a `AuthInfoService`_ that saves and retrieves
the information as needed.

.. _AuthInfoService: https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette/blob/master/app/com/mohiva/play/silhouette/api/services/AuthInfoService.scala#L31
.. _AuthInfo: https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette/blob/master/app/com/mohiva/play/silhouette/api/services/AuthInfoService.scala#L61
